    <h1>Variables in JS</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are two main types of variables and one constant.</p>
    <h2> 1.var <br> 2.let <br> 3. const</h2>

    <h2>1.var:</h2>
    <p>var is the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. It has function scope, which means it is accessible anywhere within the function it was declared in, even before the actual declaration. If a variable is declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable.</p>
       var a; <br>
       var a = 10; // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt <br>
       var a = 15;  // Re-Declaration is possible <br>
       a = 25;  // Re-Assignment is possible <br>
       console.log(a);
       <script>
        var a;
        var a = 10; // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt
        var a = 15;  // Re-Declaration is possible
        a = 25;  // Re-Assignment is possible
       console.log(a);
       </script>

    <h2>2.let:</h2>
    <p>let allows you to declare block-scoped variables. This means the variable is only accessible within the block (a block is a section of code between curly braces {}), statement, or expression where it is defined. </p>
       let nirav_marks = 90 // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt <br>
       let nirav_marks = 40 // Re-Declaration is not possible <br>
       nirav_marks = 75  // Re-assignemnt Possible <br>
       console.log(nirav_marks);
       <!-- <script>
        let nirav_marks = 90 // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt
        let nirav_marks = 40 // Re-Declaration is not possible
        nirav_marks = 75  // Re-assignemnt Possible
        console.log(nirav_marks);
       </script> -->

    <h2>3.const:</h2>
    <p>const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. Like let, const is block-scoped. It's important to note that while a const variable cannot be reassigned, if it holds an object or an array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be modified.</p>
       const fav_Person = "nirav"; // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt <br>
       const fav_Person = "krina"  // Re-Declaration is not possible <br>
       fav_Person = "krupa"  // Re-Assignemnt is not possible <br>
       console.log(fav_Person);
       <!-- <script>
        const fav_Person = "nirav"; // Initialization and Declaration or Asignemnt
        const fav_Person = "krina"  // Re-Declaration is not possible
        fav_Person = "krupa"  // Re-Assignemnt is not possible
        console.log(fav_Person);
       </script> -->
